<!---CSS Color Challenge!


Your task is to create your own (simplified) 
version of a Piet Mondrian painting 
(for example, http://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/
piet-mondrian/composition-with-red-blue-and-yellow-1930.jpg).


1. Once you've found the image you'd like to "recreate"
using HTML/CSS, place that image into the background of
the inside wrap div so that you can use it as a reference

2. Use at least the seven colored <div>s from the template 
to create something Mondrian-esque.  Think about how youâ€™ll 
need to size and position them. If your reference image will
require more than seven divs, feel free to add divs to
your HTML

3. Use a mixture of RGB, HEX and HSL to specify your colors 
- which is the easiest to use?

4. Create one or two more <div>s in color-challenge.html, 
make them transparent and place them on top of your 
current <div>s. Try to make them visually fit in to the 
original Mondrian painting.-->
